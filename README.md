This project focuses on analyzing the sentiment of downloaded documents and performing a text mining analysis on their contents. Below is a step-by-step guide outlining the key steps involved:

Steps:
Read CSV (Operator)
Load the dataset from a CSV file, which contains the documents to be analyzed.

Nominal to Text (Operator)
Convert nominal values in the dataset to text format using this operator. This ensures that the document contents are in a readable text format for further analysis.

Select Attribute (Operator)
Choose the specific attribute (column) in the dataset that you want to analyze, such as the document's text or specific metadata.

Replace (Operator)
Replace any unwanted or missing values in the dataset to clean the data before performing sentiment analysis and text mining.

Extract Sentiment (Operator)
Use the sentiment analysis operator to analyze the emotional tone (positive, negative, or neutral) of the document's content.

Generate Attributes (Operator)
Create new attributes based on the sentiment scores or other important metadata from the text mining analysis.

Write CSV (Operator)
Save the processed data, including sentiment scores and newly generated attributes, back into a CSV file for further analysis or reporting.

By following these steps, the project successfully analyzes sentiment and performs a detailed text mining analysis on document contents.
